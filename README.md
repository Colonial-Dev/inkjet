## Features

- Language grammars are linked into the executable as C functions - no need to load anything at runtime!
- Highlight code as HTML with either class names or inline styles. You can also define your own formatters, if necessary.
- Specify languages explicitly (from an `enum`) or look them up using a token.
- Easily highlight in parallel with the `threaded` module.

## FAQ

### *"Why is Inkjet so large?"*

Parser sources generated by `tree-sitter` can grow quite big, with some being dozens of megabytes in size. Inkjet has to bundle these sources for all the languages it supports, so it adds up.

### *"Why is Inkjet taking so long to build?"*

Because it has to compile and link in dozens of C/C++ programs (the parsers and scanners for every language Inkjet bundles.)

However, after the first build, these artifacts will be cached and subsequent builds should be much faster.

### *"A language I want to highlight isn't bundled with Inkjet!"*

Assuming that you or someone else has implemented a higlighting-ready `tree-sitter` grammar for the language you want, adding it to Inkjet is easy! Just open an issue asking for it to be added, linking to the grammar repository for the language.

However, please note that Inkjet currently only supports grammar repositories that check in the parser generated by `tree-sitter` (in order to avoid a build-time dependency on `node`/`npm`.)

## Acknowledgements
- Inkjet would not be possible without `tree-sitter` and the ecosystem of grammars surrounding it.
- Enhanced highlighting queries for many languages (as well as queries for languages that would otherwise not be supported!) are sourced from the [`nvim-treesitter`](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) project.
