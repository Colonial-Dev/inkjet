## Features

- Language grammars are linked into the executable as C functions - no need to load anything at runtime!
- Pluggable formatters. Inkjet includes a formatter for HTML, and you can write your own if needed.
- Highlight into a new `String` or a `std::io::Writer`, depending on your use case.
- Specify languages explicitly (from an `enum`) or look them up using a token like `"rs"` or `"rust"`.
- ~~Extremely cursed `build.rs`~~

## Cargo Features
- (Default) `html` - enables the bundled HTML formatter, which depends on `v_htmlescape` and the `theme` feature.
- (Default) `theme` - enables the theme API, which depends on `ahash`, `toml` and `serde`.
- (Default) `all-languages` - enables all languages.
- `language-{name}` - enables the specified language.
    - If you want to only enable a subset of the included languages, you'll have to set `default-features=false` and manually re-add each language you want to use.
## FAQ

### *"Why is Inkjet so large?"*

Parser sources generated by `tree-sitter` can grow quite big, with some being dozens of megabytes in size. Inkjet has to bundle these sources for all the languages it supports, so it adds up. (According to `loc`, there are over 16 *million* lines of C code!)

### *"Why is Inkjet taking so long to build?"*

Because it has to compile and link in dozens of C/C++ programs (the parsers and scanners for every language Inkjet bundles.)

However, after the first build, these artifacts will be cached and subsequent builds should be much faster.

### *"Why does highlighting require a mutable reference to the highlighter?*

Under the hood, Inkjet creates a `tree-sitter` highlighter/parser object, which in turn dynamically allocates a chunk of working memory. Using the same highlighter for multiple simultaneous jobs would therefore cause all sorts of nasty UB.

If you want to highlight in parallel, you'll have to create a clone of the highlighter for each thread.

### *"A language I want to highlight isn't bundled with Inkjet!"*

Assuming that you or someone else has implemented a highlighting-ready `tree-sitter` grammar for the language you want, adding it to Inkjet is easy! Just open an issue asking for it to be added, linking to the grammar repository for the language.

However, please note that: 
- Inkjet currently only supports grammar repositories that check in the parser generated by `tree-sitter` (in order to avoid a build-time dependency on `node`/`npm`.)
- Inkjet requires that the grammar include (at minimum) a `highlights.scm` query targeted at the base `tree-sitter` library. Extended queries (such as those from `nvim-treesitter`) will not work.
- I will not support blockchain/smart contract languages like Solidity. Please take your scam enablers to a fork.

## Building
For normal use, Inkjet will compile automatically just like any other crate.

However, if you have forked the repository and want to update the bundled languages, you'll need to set some environment variables:
- `INKJET_REDOWNLOAD_LANGS` will wipe the `languages/` directory and redownload everything from scratch.
- `INKJET_REBUILD_LANGS_MODULE` will wipe `src/languages.rs` and regenerate it from scratch.

The value of these variables doesn't matter - they just have to be set.

## Acknowledgements
- Inkjet would not be possible without `tree-sitter` and the ecosystem of grammars surrounding it.
- Many languages are only supported thanks to the highlighting queries created by the [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) project.
